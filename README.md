# Concept

Our prototype is the one of online word tagging platforms 'Kkutu'. However, to improve the outline of the game and in-game experience, I thought I need to build a new word tagging game platform.

## What is word tag game?

Word tag game is also known as 'Word chains', 'Last and first', 'Grab one behind' and 'Shiritori'(Japanese).

### How it will be going on online?

Players should say the next word which starts with the last letter from the given word or the last letter from the word another player said. If someone failed to say the word in time, he/she will lose the game.

It is including simple rules. However, the game will get harder as the game goes. It is because of the limit of playtime. Total playtime is a minute and it can be changed by the game starter before the game started.

## Changes from 'Kkutu'(prototype)

Our main goal is a healthy community of the game and project. The prototype software of current project called 'Kkutu' is also one of word tag game platform. However, its community is suffering from a lot of community-based crackers and poor in-game experiences.
